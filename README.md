Here is your second HTML assignment! Take a look at the document below. There are a few things I would like you to add:

When you add the bullet points, I would like you to add three things that are in your bucket list.

For the numbers list, I would like you to add your top three favorite foods. 
Note: Make sure you make it clear what the lists are. If you put yourself in the users of your website's shoes you would want to know what those lists represent! 
Maybe add some text right before you add the lists.

For the image, make it an image of your favorite move. Below the image explain why it is your favorite movie and what is your favorite scene from the movie.

Try to replicate what the website looks like on the PDF. You can choose whatever colors you want. They do not have to match the colors in the website image.
